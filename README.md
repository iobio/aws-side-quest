Don't worry if you get stuck. This is mostly a learning exercise. I'll provide more rigorous backend training in the future.

# Create a virtual machine

* Ubuntu 22.04
* Use a small instance type. Just 2 cores/2 GB memory or similar. Give it a relatively large (160GB+) storage volume in order to handle the iobio backend data.


# Install docker

* Instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)


# Try running the iobio backend in docker on the VM

* Instructions [here](https://github.com/iobio/iobio-gru-backend)


# Delete the VM (and the volume(s))
